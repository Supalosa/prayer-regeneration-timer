# Prayer Regeneration Helper
A plugin to remind the player that their Prayer Regeneration Potion has expired. The reminder text and color can be customised.

Also includes an option to count down to the next prayer regeneration tick: this occurs on "12" (when the number turns green).

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/PortAGuy/thrall-helper and https://github.com/MoreBuchus/buchus-plugins/tree/cox-additions
